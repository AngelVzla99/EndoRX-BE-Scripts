Tag: [NEW] [GOOD] Primitive ID: 694aa1e9360194e67e59903d Feedback: 5  | Description: Endometriosis is associated with high levels of oxidative stress. Antioxidants, abundant in berries, leafy greens, and colorful vegetables, help neutralize free radicals, thereby reducing cellular damage and inflammation in the pelvic cavity.
Tag: [NEW] [MEDIUM_GOOD] Primitive ID: 694aa1e9360194e67e5991fe Feedback: 4  | Description: Endometriosis can lead to hypertonic (overly tight) pelvic floor muscles.

Tag: [NEW] [MEDIUM_GOOD] Primitive ID: 694aa1e9360194e67e598fa1 Feedback: 4  | Description: Endometriosis can lead to pelvic floor muscle tension (hypertonicity), contributing to pain. Exercises like deep diaphragmatic breathing combined with conscious relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles can alleviate this tension and reduce pain.
Tag: [NEW] [MEDIUM_GOOD] Primitive ID: 694aa1e9360194e67e598faa Feedback: 4  | Description: Deep belly breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting a state of 'rest and digest.' This can lower stress, reduce the perception of pain, and gently massage the internal organs, which may ease bloating and discomfort.
