2025-12-04 13:14:11 [info]: Some research suggests a potential relationship between stress and endometriosis. For instance, one paper from 2020, "Is stress a cause or a consequence of endometriosis?", indicates that this relationship is an area of ongoing study. Other documents also mention neuroendocrine and stress-related aspects of endometriosis, and the impact of endometriosis on quality of life and mental health, where pelvic pain can play a significant role.

From the audio scribes, one patient noted that stress worsened her nausea. This highlights how stress can impact the experience of symptoms for individuals with endometriosis.

While these documents point to a connection, they don't definitively state whether stress causes endometriosis or is a result of it, but rather suggest an interplay. Managing stress is often considered a supportive strategy for overall well-being, which can be beneficial for individuals managing chronic conditions.
